  <p>Our project is copied from TheAlgorithms/C,</p>
  <p>open source project for C algorithms in github.</p>
  <p>We are going to add some sorting algorithms(e.g. Radix sorting)</p> 
  <p>and data structure algorithms.</p>
  <p>Also, we will find problems in existing codes and edit them.</p>
  <p>Our final goal is to give pull requests to TheAlgorithms/C and take some comments to them.</p>
  <p>We expect our project very energetic!</p><p>If you want to connect us and to see codes, please send to team leader E-mail tajanboy0359@naver.com</p>
