## About Project
### project name : bjornbytes/lovr
![image_bjornbytes/lovr](https://lovr.org/)

These days we can see VR easily. VR playroom was made near our campus, and many VR videos can easily found on youtube. Therefore, contributing to VR opensource project might valuable since manhy projects related will be advanced.
In this project, we can use LOVR to create VR experiences without much setup. LOVR is a simple Lua framework for building VR experiences. Since it’s simple, we think we can easily use this framework.
Maybe we can upload some instructive videos to the internet, or can make virtual, practical playground for urgent situations for police officers, ambulance workers, and fire fighters.
