Our project is copied from TheAlgorithms/C, open source project for C algorithms in github.  
We are going to add some sorting algorithms(e.g. Radix sorting) and data structure algorithms.  
Also, we will find problems in existing codes and edit them.   
Our final goal is to give pull requests to TheAlgorithms/C and take some comments to them.   
We expect our project very energetic!

## exercism
In this directory you will find (in the right order):
* hello-world
* isogram
* acronym
* word-count
* rna-transcription

## Simple Client Server Implementation
This directory contains
* client.c
* server.c

First execute server.c in a terminal and then client.c in a different terminal. Enables communication between two terminals.
